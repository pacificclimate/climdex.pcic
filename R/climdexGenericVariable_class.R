#' Class definition for ClimdexGenericVariable
#' @title ClimdexGenericVariable
#' 
#' @description
#' This class represents the base for handling both scalar and vector generic climate data.
#' It is used internally to construct single-variable, climdexInput-like objects for caclulating basic climate indices.

## Class definition declaration
#' @title ClimdexGenericVector
#' 
#' @description
#' The `ClimdexGenericVector` class contains vector climate data (e.g., wind speed and direction), consisting of
#' both primary and secondary components, and other data required for days for calculating basic climate indices.
#'
#' @details
#' The `primary` slot contains the main numeric climate data, such as wind speed or another magnitude-based variable.
#' The `secondary` slot provides complementary information, such as direction, and its type and meaning depend on the 
#' `format`:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{polar}: When the format is `"polar"`, the `primary` slot represents magnitude (e.g., wind speed),
#'   and the `secondary` slot must be numeric and represents direction in degrees (e.g., wind direction, where 0Â° is North).
#'   \item \strong{cartesian}: In `"cartesian"` format, `primary` and `secondary` both represent numeric values, typically the
#'   x and y components of a vector (e.g., velocity components in the x and y directions).
#'   \item \strong{cardinal}: When the format is `"cardinal"`, the `primary` slot still represents a numeric value (e.g., wind speed),
#'   but the `secondary` slot is a character vector representing cardinal directions (e.g., "N", "NE", "E", etc.).
#' }
#' This class is designed to handle both magnitude and direction data in various forms, allowing flexibility in representing
#' vector climate data depending on the source.
#'
#' @section Slots:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{primary}{A numeric vector representing the primary climate data (e.g., wind speed).}
#'   \item{secondary}{A vector representing the secondary climate data (e.g., wind direction).}
#'   \item{format}{A string indicating the format of the data: "polar", "cartesian", or "cardinal".}
#'   \item{dates}{A `PCICt` type vector of dates.}
#'   \item{date.factors}{Factors used for creation of annual, seasonal and monthly indices.}
#'   \item{jdays}{Julian days for the date sequence.}
#'   \item{namasks}{Data quality masks for annual, seasonal and monthly data.}
