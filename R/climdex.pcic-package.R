#' climdex.pcic, an implementation of the ETCCDI climate change indices.
#' 
#' This package implements the ETCCDI's 27 core climate change indices
#' efficiently in R.
#' 
#' The calculation of climate extremes are important in many disciplines.
#' Annual maximum daily precipitation, annual maximum wind speed, and other
#' such extremes are used in many engineering applications. However, they are
#' not as useful when speaking about climate change.
#' 
#' The Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indicies (ETCCDI) has
#' created a set of 27 core indices with the intent of capturing the change in
#' the extremes of climate and in selected parameters deemed relevant to other
#' disciplines. These model the following types of parameters: \itemize{ \item
#' Shifts in the number of days where comparatively extreme conditions are
#' observed.  \item Growing season length.  \item 10th and 90th percentiles of
#' temperature versus baseline conditions.  \item Lengths of warm, cold, wet,
#' and dry spells.  \item Counts of days where precipitation exceeds a
#' threshold.  \item Total precipitation where precipitation exceeds the 95th
#' or 99th percentile of the baseline.  }
#' 
#' The \code{climdex.pcic} package provides an implementation of the ETCCDI's
#' 27 core climate change indices. It aims to be reasonably high performance,
#' to handle non-Gregorian calendar types, to be as correct as possible given
#' the definitions of the indices, and to have sufficiently readable and
#' concise code as to facilitate easy verification by inspection.
